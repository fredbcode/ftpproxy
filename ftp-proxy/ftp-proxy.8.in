.TH ftp-proxy 8 "September 20th, 1999" "SuSE" "Proxy-Suite"
.SH NAME
ftp-proxy \- application level proxy for the FTP protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ftp-proxy [-c] [-d|-i] [-f file] [-n] [-v level] [-V]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FTP-Proxy
acts as an application level gateway between FTP clients and servers.
Its main purpose is to secure local FTP servers against possibly
insecure clients or malicious attacks.  FTP-Proxy is believed to be
immune against current known attacks based on the FTP protocol.
.PP
FTP-Proxy can be started from the inetd (or xinetd, or any other)
internet super daemon or executed on its own as a standalone daemon,
in which case it will fork child processes to handle connections.
The behaviour depends on the
.B ftp-proxy.conf(5)
configuration option
.B ServerType
or the 
.B \-i
and
.B \-d
command line switches, where the latter two take precedence.
.PP
FTP-Proxy features a rich set of auditing and command restriction
capabilities and is specifically suited for deployment in firewall
environments.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-V
Print the program's version information and terminate with
exit code 0.
.TP
.B \-c
Read the configuration file, output its contents sorted by section
and option name to standard output, and terminate with exit code 0.
This option is mostly interesting for diagnostic purposes.
.TP
.B \-d
Force FTP-Proxy to run in standalone (daemon) mode, even if a
.B ServerType inetd
directive exists in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-i
Force FTP-Proxy to run in inetd mode, even if a 
.B ServerType standalone
directive exists in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-f \fIfilename\fR
Specify an alternate configuration file to be read instead of
the standard
.B @SYSCONFDIR@/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf
file.
.sp
Please note that the default path for the configuration file
is a compile time option. It can be changed using the
.B \-\-prefix
and
.B \-\-sysconfdir
options when running the
.B configure
script - see also the
.B INSTALL
file for usage description.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.  This prevents
the default of becoming a daemon and is ignored if running in
.B inetd
mode.  The main purpose of this option is to support the AIX
System Resource Controller or similar setups, where several
daemons are controlled by a master daemon.
.TP
.B \-v \fIlevel\fR
Enable diagnostic output to be sent to the
file \fB/tmp/ftp-proxy.debug\fR.
The given level must be in the range from 0 (no output at all)
to 4 (maximum verbosity). See also
.B DIAGNOSTICS
bellow.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT
These signals instruct FTP-Proxy to abort any existing transfer,
close all connections and terminate the process. If the target of
the signal is a running FTP-Proxy daemon, all current child
processes wil also be terminated.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
This signal will be accepted if running in daemon mode and
ignored in inetd mode.
.br
It causes the FTP-Proxy to reread its configuration file
and to reopen the log destination if it was changed in the
configuration file, or rotated if it is a log file.
.br
See also dedicated rotation singnal
.B SIGUSR1
bellow.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
This signal will be accepted if running in daemon mode and
ignored in inetd mode.
.br
It causes the FTP-Proxy to close its current logfile, rename
it to a date and time derived value, and open a new logfile.
This procedure is also known as \fILogfile Rotation\fR.
Child processes forked before the reception of this signal
and processes run from
.B inetd
will not be affected.
.br
See also the
.B ServerRoot
configuration option in
.B ftp-proxy.conf(5).
.SH NOTES
When running FTP-Proxy in
.B inetd
mode, it is always an excellent idea to check that the inetd
configuration file includes a line that invokes FTP-Proxy.
An example for a line in
.B /etc/inetd.conf
follows:
.PP
.B ftp stream tcp nowait root @SBINDIR@/ftp-proxy -i
.PP
Please note that this is just an example and does not provide
much security, like running as a non-privileged user or using
the
.B TCP Wrapper
functionality.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The
.B \-v
option is is only avaliable if enabled using the
.B \-\-enable-debug
option when running the configure script - see also the
.B INSTALL
file for usage description.
This option should be used with great care only. It is strongly
recommended to not to use it in production environments.
.PP
If debugging is activated, it always adds output to the file
.B /tmp/ftp-proxy.debug
which is created with
.B 0666
mode.  This allows child processes to open and write the
file after they have given up their root privileges.
.PP
If the configuration file contains a
.B ServerRoot
directive, child processes and processes run from
.B inetd
will try to open the file within their
.B chroot(2)
environment.  If this fails, e.g. because there is no
.B /tmp
directory, it is silently ignored and no debug output
is generated.
.PP
Please note that the program makes no attempt to erase
the debug file after use.  Thus it will stay around with
world writeability until the operator manually removes it!
